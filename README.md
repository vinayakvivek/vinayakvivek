- :rabbit2: Computer graphics enthusiast.
  - ðŸŒ± learning shader coding and trying out shadertoy
  - ðŸ”­ currently reading PBRT (Physically Based Rendering) and trying to understand the detailed implementation.
- :octocat: Like you, I cannot bring myself to look at badly written code.
- :gem: Good architecture and code <3.
- ðŸŒ¿ Favorite frameworks
  - [three.js](https://threejs.org/): beautiful library to get create web based 3D graphics
  - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): started learning it recently, fell in love with it straight away.
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/): React code with hooks is just too beautiful to write and look at.
  - [spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): had to learn it for team project, but now I realize it's beauty.
  - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): even tho I'm not too much into ML, I love playing around with pytorch.
- ðŸŽ® Favorite games
  - [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order): Experience what it takes to truly be a Jedi during the Imperial era. This game is an experience that any Star Wars fan shouldn't miss out on. Amazing gameplay, graphics, story and epic boss fights.
  - [Manifold Garden](https://manifold.garden/): If you love gravity puzzles and infinities, this one's for you. Minimal, beautiful graphics. <br/>According to GameSpot, *"Manifold Garden is a feast for the eyes and the mind"*, and I wouldn't say otherwise.
