- :rabbit2: Computer graphics enthusiast.
  - I still haven't implemented PBRT tho
- :octocat: Like you, I cannot bring myself to look at badly written code.
- :gem: Good architecture and code <3.
- :seedling: Favorite frameworks
  - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): started learning it recently, fell in love with it straight away.
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/): React code with hooks is just too beautiful to write and look at.
  - [spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): had to learn it for team project, but now I realize it's beauty.
  - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): even tho I'm not too much into ML, I love playing around with pytorch.
